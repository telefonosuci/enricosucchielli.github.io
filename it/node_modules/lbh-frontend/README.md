The Hackney Design System contains everything you need to build user interfaces for Hackney platforms and services.

We have a [Codepen](https://codepen.io/jhackett1/pen/xxRWWKv) for you to quickly experiment with code samples from the design system, and a [prototype kit](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/lbh-simple-frontend) for making flows to share with stakeholders or use in research.

We have [starter kits](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/hackney-design-system-examples/) for using the design system in production.
